# Self Referential Associations / Friending on Rails!

## Learning Objectives
- Explain how self-referential associations are used to create relationships within a single model
- Use `:class_name` to alias a model
- Create a join table to that associates instances of a single model
- Add validations to a join model

## Opening Framing
We've learned about associations and how we can relate models to one another. Sometimes we need to associate instances of a model with other instances of the same model.

For the mini-lesson, we'll be looking at how to execute friending functionality in a rails application. Though we are looking at the domain model for friending, the functionality we'll be coding can easily transfer to another domain that requires associations between instances of the same Object.

The application we're about to build will have 2 models: `user` and `friendship`. Since you are building on Projects in progress, we'll start with a codebase that simulates that situation...

## Potential Next Steps/Other Applications
