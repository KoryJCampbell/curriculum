# Front End Fundamentals

## Learning Goal
Build an interactive web-page that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Learning Objectives

### Intro to WDI
- Get to know our fellow students
- Determine some guiding principles for our class culture
- Identify our big goal for the course
- List the core expectations for instructors and students
- Map out the various topics and technologies of web development
- Identify how those technologies fit into the arc of the course
- List two "soft" goals on which to focus for the first week.
- Explain the role of Fundamentals relative the rest of the course.

### Intro to the Web and HTML
- Diagram the relationship between a server and a browser, including responses and requests.
- Explain the difference between `http://` and `file://`.
- Semantically structure a given document using HTML without regard to style.
- List commonly-abused HTML elements.
- Label the components of an HTML element and its tags.
- List commonly-used special characters.
- Run a website through a validator and fix its errors accordingly.
- Identify the different roles of HTML, CSS, and Javascript on a given webpage.
- Link to a given file using either absolute and relative paths.
- Use Chrome Dev Tools to inspect an element.

### The CLI (Command Line Interface)

#### Concepts

- Compare and contrast CLIs / GUIs
- Explain how command line usage can increase efficiency
- Describe the anatomy of a command (statement, flags, arguments)
- Explain what a path is, and why the 'current path' is important in the CLI
- Explain the difference between an absolute path and a relative path

#### Mechanics

- Setup your working directory / environment for WDI
- List common commands to
  - View the path of the current directory
  - View the contents of a directory
  - Navigate to different directories
  - Manage files and directories
- Open files and directories with Atom
- List unsafe commands

### Git
#### Conceptual

- Describe why developers use version control
- Illustrate how Git works as a version control system
- Explain how Git allows us as developers to:
  - Revert to past versions
  - Keep track of what each version 'meant'
  - Compare changes to past versions
  - Collaborate / discuss changes
  - Be Fearless to make changes
- Identify how the components of a local git repository relate:
  - repo, working tree, index (aka staging area), commit
- Distinguish between git as a tool, and Github as a service

#### Mechanical
- Initialize a local git repository
- Add and commit changes to a git repository
- Add a remote repository, and push/pull changes to that remote
- Use the 'fork, clone, and pull request' model to submit assignments

### CSS Intro
- Construct a CSS rule using selectors, declarations, properties, and values
- Articulate the pros and cons of stylesheets, styles in the head, and in-line styles
- Define "cascading" in the context of CSS specificity
- Style the size, color, border, text, and font of all elements of a given tag on a page
- Demonstrate the use of class and ID selectors to target specific element(s)
- Distinguish between block and inline display values
- Identify the components of the box model
- Differentiate between the border-box and content-box values for box-sizing
- Apply knowledge of the box model to adjust spacing between and around elements on a page
- Bookmark 2-3 good resources that developers can use refer to for CSS help

### JS Data Types, Variables, and Arrays
- Describe the role Javascript (JS) plays alongside HTML and CSS.
- Define JS as a programming language.
- Set up and use Node to manipulate JS data types.
- List JS data types and how each is used.
- Describe composite data types and use arrays and objects to store data types.
- Practice proper JS syntax and semantic variable naming.
- Explain what a variable is and the role memory allocation plays in storing data types.

### JS Loops and Conditionals
- differentiate between true & false && truthy & falsey
- describe why control flow is utilized in computer programming
- write an if, else if, and else statement in JS
- write a for loop and while loop in JS and differentiate between them
- Utilize loops to iterate through complex data types
- write a JS program that utilizes conditionals and loops
### JS Functions and Objects

### Functions
- Explain what a function is
- Define a function in JavaScript using a declaration and an expression
- Recognize the parts of both
- Explain arguments (introduce scope)
- Compare and contrast the two (explain hoisting)
- Distinguish referencing and invocation
- State the difference between Output and Side Effects
- Show why functions are important and giving an example

### Objects
- Discuss datatypes (simple datatypes vs. collections)
- Define an object literal (empty and populated)
- Compare and contrast objects and arrays
- Identify and differentiate two modes of element retrieval
- Compare retrieval and updating of properties
- Explain property deletion (contrast array)
- Introduce namespace
- Use functions as properties (methods)
- Use nested data structures

### JS Objects and Functions

- Compare objects and key-value stores to arrays as data structures
- Explain the difference between object properties and methods
- Create empty objects and objects with multiple properties and methods using object literal syntax
- Compare adding and retrieving properties to objects using dot and bracket notation
- Iterate over the keys of an object to return and manipulate values
- Define what a function is
- Define hoisting
- Differentiate between referencing and invoking a function

### JS and the Document Object Model (DOM)

- Explain what the DOM is and how it is structured
- Select and target DOM elements using DOM methods
- Select and target DOM elements using a query selector
- Create, read, update, and delete DOM elements
- Change the attributes or content of a DOM element

### JS Debugging

- Identify and resolve common and uncommon "logical errors" that affect the results of your program
- Use logs to troubleshoot errors in an application (console log in Dev Tools)
- Conduct real-time debugging in the browser (start small, triangulation, remove code)
- Access properties of a object
- Use debuggers and breakpoints to identify logical errors in expressions
