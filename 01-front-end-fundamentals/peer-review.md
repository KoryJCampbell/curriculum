# Peer Review

For the next hour, we'll be forming pairs, and reviewing each others' work. Code is significantly improved by a second set of eyes.

Both of you will spend 30 minutes improving the other's code, while they look on and discuss their code with you. After that 30 minutes, you will swap, and spend the next 30 minutes on the other person's code.

**Note:** You should **not** be implementing any new functionality during this exercise, only refactoring existing code.

By the end of this hour, the code for both of you should, at minimum:
- Be immaculately indented
- Pass the HTML and CSS validators with flying colors
  - [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)
  - [CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
- Contain only variables and functions that are semantically-named

In other words, your code should be easy to read -- both by your standards, and those of prospective employers.
